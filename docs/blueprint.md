# **App Name**: Slide Sort Puzzle

## Core Features:

- Level Selection: Allow the user to select a level between 3 and 10 (board size).
- Board Initialization: Create the game board with randomized numbers and a single 'hole'.
- Block Movement: Enable the movement of blocks into the 'hole' when clicked.
- Move Validation: Highlight valid moves, showing the user blocks in the same row/column as the hole.
- Win Condition Check: Check for win condition and inform the user.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Dark blue (#34495E) to evoke a sense of logic and focus, suitable for a puzzle game. This provides a strong contrast to the interactive elements.
- Background color: Light gray (#E0E0E0) provides a clean, non-distracting backdrop.
- Accent color: Bright orange (#FF851B) to highlight interactive elements like selectable blocks.
- Font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif, for all UI elements due to its modern and objective appearance, ensuring readability and a clean interface.
- Use simple, clear icons to indicate game options like level selection. Icons should be easily recognizable and non-distracting.
- The game board should be centered on the screen with sufficient padding around it. Use a grid-based layout to align blocks neatly.
- Use subtle animations for block movements to provide visual feedback and make the interaction more engaging. Keep animations short and smooth to maintain focus.
